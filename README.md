# Robust Partial Least Squares Algorithm based on Multivariate Kendall’s Tau (MKPLS)
• A simple and efficient robust PLS method for low-dimensional, high-dimensional, and multiple-response data.
• Adopted the multivariate Kendall's tau statistic to build the robust covariance matrix.
• This algorithm could be robust against the heavy-tailed elliptical distribution datas and noises.

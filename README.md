# Robust Partial Least Squares Algorithm based on Multivariate Kendall’s Tau (MKPLS)
• Proposed a Robust Partial Least Squares algorithm that could be used to deal with high-dimensional regressors and one or several response variables. 

• Exploited a multivariate Kendall's tau statistic to estimate a latent scatter matrix of the elliptical data, so that could be robust against the heavy-tailed elliptical distribution datas and noises.
